\section{The Search Problem}
%How have you formulated the game as a search problem?
The game has been reduced to finding a path for each piece to its respective goal destination
%(You could discuss how you view the problem interms of states, actions, goal tests, and path costs, for example.)
\section{The Algorithm}
%What search algorithm does your program use to solve this problem, and why did you choose this algorithm?(You  could  comment  on  the  algorithm’s  efficiency,  completeness,  and  optimality.
%You  could  explain  anyheuristics you may have developed to inform your search, including commenting on their admissibility.)
\section{Time and Space Requirements}
%What features of the problem and your program’s input impact your program’s time and space requirements?
%(You might discuss the branching factor and depth of your search tree, and explain any other features of theinput which affect the time and space complexity of your algorithm.)
